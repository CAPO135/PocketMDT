# Context Separation Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Solved

The central orchestrator was **NOT** properly using document content from the vector store to provide context to agents. Instead, it was treating document content as `user_profile`, which created confusion between user questions and medical data.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Before the Fix:
1. **Poor Context Structure**: Document content was passed as `user_profile` parameter
2. **Confused Agents**: Agents couldn't distinguish between user input and medical data
3. **Mixed Concerns**: User questions and medical documents were treated as the same thing
4. **Ineffective Prompts**: Agent prompts didn't clearly separate user questions from medical context

### The Issue:
```python
# OLD APPROACH - PROBLEMATIC
def orchestrate(self, user_input: str, user_profile: str = "", ...):
    context = {
        "user_input": user_input,
        "user_profile": user_profile,  # Document content mixed with user profile
        # ...
    }

# Agent received confused context
def run(self, context):
    input_data = context.get("user_profile", "")  # Mixed user + document data
    prompt = self.prompt_template.format(input_data=input_data)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Central Orchestrator Changes** (`Server/modules/central_orchestrator/agent.py`)

**Before:**
```python
def create_context(self, user_input: str, user_profile: str = "", ...):
    return {
        "user_input": user_input,
        "user_profile": user_profile,  # Mixed data
        # ...
    }

def orchestrate(self, user_input: str, user_profile: str = "", ...):
```

**After:**
```python
def create_context(self, user_input: str, document_context: str = "", ...):
    return {
        "user_input": user_input,
        "document_context": document_context,  # Clear separation
        # ...
    }

def orchestrate(self, user_input: str, document_context: str = "", ...):
```

### 2. **Route Changes** (`Server/routes/ask_questions.py`)

**Before:**
```python
result = agent.orchestrate(question, user_profile=document_content)
```

**After:**
```python
result = agent.orchestrate(question, document_context=document_content)
```

### 3. **Agent Prompt Improvements**

**Before:**
```python
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
User Data:
{input_data}
""")

def run(self, context):
    input_data = context.get("user_profile", "")
    prompt = self.prompt_template.format(input_data=input_data)
```

**After:**
```python
prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
User Question:
{user_input}

IMPORTANT: The following information comes from uploaded medical documents and lab reports. Use this as your primary source for analysis.

Document Context (from uploaded medical files):
{document_context}
""")

def run(self, context):
    user_input = context.get("user_input", "")
    document_context = context.get("document_context", "")
    prompt = self.prompt_template.format(user_input=user_input, document_context=document_context)
```

## Complete Flow Now

### 1. **Document Upload & Storage**
- PDFs uploaded to Pinecone vector store ✅
- Documents chunked and embedded ✅

### 2. **User Query Processing**
- User asks question via `/ask/` endpoint
- Query embedded and matched against vector store ✅
- Relevant documents retrieved ✅

### 3. **Context Creation**
- **User input**: Extracted from the question
- **Document context**: Extracted from vector store results
- **Clear separation**: Two distinct data sources

### 4. **Agent Execution**
- Central orchestrator routes to appropriate agent
- Agent receives both user question AND document context
- Agent can distinguish between user intent and medical data

### 5. **Analysis & Response**
- Agent analyzes user question in context of medical documents
- Response addresses user's specific question using their medical data
- Personalized, data-driven recommendations

## Verification Results

### Test Output Example:
```
User Question: 'What do my thyroid results mean and should I be concerned?'

Document Context: 82 words of medical data (lab results, symptoms, etc.)

Agent Analysis:
1. Summary of Findings:
   The laboratory report shows that your Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level 
   is elevated at 6.8 mIU/L, which is above the reference range of 0.4-4.0 mIU/L...

2. Clinical Interpretation:
   The elevated TSH and low Free T4 and Free T3 levels suggest primary hypothyroidism...

3. Recommendations:
   You should consult with your healthcare provider about starting thyroid hormone 
   replacement therapy...
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- User questions are distinct from medical data
- Agents can properly interpret both inputs

### ✅ **Improved Prompt Structure**
- Agents receive structured context with clear labels
- Better understanding of what data comes from where

### ✅ **Enhanced Analysis Quality**
- Agents reference specific lab values from documents
- Recommendations based on actual patient data
- Personalized responses that address user questions

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- Responses directly answer user questions
- Medical analysis based on uploaded documents
- Professional, data-driven recommendations

### ✅ **Maintainable Architecture**
- Clear data flow from vector store to agents
- Proper separation of user input vs. document context
- Easy to extend and modify

## Files Modified

1. **`Server/modules/central_orchestrator/agent.py`**
   - Updated `create_context()` method
   - Updated `orchestrate()` method signature
   - Changed parameter names for clarity

2. **`Server/routes/ask_questions.py`**
   - Updated orchestrator call to use `document_context` parameter
   - Improved logging for document retrieval

3. **`Server/modules/endocrinologist/agent.py`**
   - Updated prompt template to separate user input and document context
   - Modified `run()` method to handle both context types

4. **`Server/modules/gastroenterologist/agent.py`**
   - Same improvements as endocrinologist agent

5. **Test Files**
   - `Server/test_document_context.py` - Updated for new parameter names
   - `Server/verify_context_separation.py` - New verification script

## Testing

Run the verification scripts to confirm the fix:

```bash
cd Server
python test_document_context.py
python verify_context_separation.py
```

Both scripts should show:
- ✅ Proper context separation
- ✅ Agents receiving both user input and document context
- ✅ Analysis based on actual medical data
- ✅ Responses that address user questions using their documents

## Conclusion

The central orchestrator now properly uses document content from the vector store to provide context to agents. The key improvement is the clear separation between:

- **`user_input`**: The user's question or concern
- **`document_context`**: Medical data from uploaded documents

This allows agents to provide more accurate, personalized, and relevant medical analysis based on the user's specific questions and their actual medical data.
