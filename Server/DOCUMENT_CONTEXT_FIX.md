# Document Context Fix for Endocrinologist Agent

## Issue Identified

The endocrinologist agent was **NOT** properly using the uploaded documents from the vector store as context when analyzing user queries. Here's what was happening:

### Before the Fix:
1. ✅ Documents were uploaded to Pinecone vector store correctly
2. ✅ Vector store was queried when user asked questions
3. ❌ **Document content was passed as `user_profile` instead of proper context**
4. ❌ **Agents couldn't distinguish between user input and document context**
5. ❌ **Poor separation of concerns between user questions and medical data**

### Root Cause:
The orchestrator was treating document content as `user_profile` instead of providing it as separate `document_context` to agents. This caused:
1. Confusion between user questions and medical data
2. Agents not properly utilizing both user input and document context
3. Poor prompt structure that didn't clearly separate user questions from medical data

## Fix Applied

### 1. Modified Central Orchestrator (`Server/modules/central_orchestrator/agent.py`)
```python
# BEFORE:
def create_context(self, user_input: str, user_profile: str = "", conversation_history: Optional[List[Dict]] = None) -> dict:
    return {
        "user_input": user_input,
        "user_profile": user_profile,  # Document content was mixed with user profile
        # ...
    }

# AFTER:
def create_context(self, user_input: str, document_context: str = "", conversation_history: Optional[List[Dict]] = None) -> dict:
    return {
        "user_input": user_input,
        "document_context": document_context,  # Clear separation of concerns
        # ...
    }
```

### 2. Updated `/ask/` Route (`Server/routes/ask_questions.py`)
```python
# BEFORE:
result = agent.orchestrate(question, user_profile=document_content)

# AFTER:
result = agent.orchestrate(question, document_context=document_content)
```

### 3. Enhanced Agent Prompts
Updated both `EndocrinologistAgent` and `GastroenterologistAgent` to properly separate user input from document context:

```python
# BEFORE:
"User Data:\n{input_data}"

# AFTER:
"User Question:\n{user_input}\n\nIMPORTANT: The following information comes from uploaded medical documents and lab reports. Use this as your primary source for analysis.\n\nDocument Context (from uploaded medical files):\n{document_context}"
```

### 3. Improved Logging
Added better logging to track when documents are retrieved and used:
- Logs number of vector store matches
- Logs when documents are found/not found
- Logs number of documents being used for context

## Verification

### Test Results:
The test script `test_document_context.py` confirms the fix works:

1. **Direct Agent Test**: Endocrinologist agent correctly analyzes thyroid lab results from sample document
2. **Orchestrator Test**: Central orchestrator routes to endocrinologist and provides proper analysis
3. **Document Context**: Agent specifically references the uploaded lab results in its analysis

### Sample Output:
```
Endocrinologist Analysis:
1. Summary of Findings:
The patient, John Doe, has reported symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and constipation. His laboratory results show elevated TSH (4.2 mIU/L) and low levels of Free T4 (0.8 ng/dL) and Free T3 (2.1 pg/mL)...

2. Clinical Interpretation:
The elevated TSH and low Free T4 and Free T3 levels suggest hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. This condition can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, dry skin, and constipation, which John Doe has reported...

3. Recommendations:
John Doe should be started on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, such as levothyroxine, to help normalize his thyroid hormone levels and alleviate his symptoms...
```

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow:
1. **Document Upload**: PDFs uploaded and stored in Pinecone vector store
2. **User Query**: User asks question via `/ask/` endpoint
3. **Vector Search**: Query embedded and matched against stored documents
4. **Context Extraction**: Retrieved document content extracted and formatted
5. **Agent Routing**: Central orchestrator determines relevant agent (e.g., endocrinologist)
6. **Document-Aware Analysis**: Agent receives document context and provides analysis based on uploaded medical data
7. **Response**: User receives analysis that specifically references their uploaded documents

### Key Benefits:
- ✅ **Clear separation of concerns**: User questions vs. medical document context
- ✅ **Better prompt structure**: Agents can distinguish between user input and medical data
- ✅ **Improved analysis**: Agents reference specific lab values and medical information from documents
- ✅ **Enhanced accuracy**: Analysis based on actual patient data rather than generic responses
- ✅ **Better user experience**: Personalized responses that directly address user questions using their medical data

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
cd Server
python test_document_context.py
```

This will test both direct agent usage and full orchestrator flow with document context.
